• Detailed instructions (key controls, game hack, answer
* key, etc) on how to use and run your application:
* 1) WASD to control the player
* 2) Spacebar to jump
* 3) Hold shift to sprint
* 4) E to interact with doors and collect items (envelopes, gifts and key)
     
* Game Hack and Answer Key:
* 6) There are 2 keys in the whole level, find just any 1 of them to unlock all the doors
* 7) For gifts, u can only collect the ones with plain green wrapping paper and red ribbon (rest r just decos)
* 8) When crossing area with lava + blue balls, do take note that u cannot step on ALL of them
* 9) Maybe there is something hidden in a tiny forest and an army of something
* 10) Find all 20 envelopes and 10 gifts to complete the game!
  11) Finding both keys wont be required to complete the game. Still a collectible, just not compulsory 
  


• Platforms/hardware/desired settings required to run your
application:
* Windows

• Limitations or bugs in the application:
* Respawn and falling icicles does not work all the time,
* could be issue of the player capsule code, hence health system is not the best
* (health going up and down in a loop if player takes dmg continuosly, else, they can respawn)
* When collecting the items or opening door, might need to change the angle or move back n forth to do so if no reaction
* For envelope, raycasting only works on the wax seal stamp 
* When in contact with lava, the sfx is quite soft
